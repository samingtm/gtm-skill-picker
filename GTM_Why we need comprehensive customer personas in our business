# How Comprehensive Customer Personas Drive B2B SaaS Success

Ever wonder why some B2B SaaS deals close smoothly while others stall? The secret lies in understanding and leveraging comprehensive customer personas. As someone who has worked closely with sales teams in the B2B SaaS market, I’ve seen firsthand how crucial it is to organize customer information effectively. Sales teams often have valuable insights but may overlook the importance of formalizing this knowledge into actionable strategies.

Creating detailed customer personas allows businesses to deliver targeted messages to various stakeholders in the buyer process, including end users, tech leaders, and decision-makers. This approach not only streamlines communication but also strengthens growth potential.

Many may think that developing a user profile is sufficient for driving product enhancements. However, when your target audience is a company rather than individual customers, it’s essential to think beyond the end users. Your product must appeal to both the end users and the decision-makers who approve its purchase.

In my experience, [Product Marketing Managers](https://www.coursera.org/articles/product-marketing-manager) (PMMs) and [Go-To-Market](https://www.coursera.org/articles/go-to-market-strategy) (GTM) strategists should collaborate closely with product teams for feature enablement and roadmap research. They must also work alongside sales teams to prepare for customer engagement at events such as seminars, roadshows, and conferences.

Understanding how end users interact with products is vital. However, simply converting end users into advocates is not enough; we need to ensure that decision-makers are also engaged and informed. In one scenario I observed, decision-makers ranged from tech leadership to C-level executives, each with unique concerns and priorities.

## Understanding Stakeholders’ Needs
Different stakeholders prioritize different aspects of a product. Here’s how various groups evaluate potential purchases:

### End Users:

* Does this product reduce my workload?
* Is it easy to onboard?
* Will it address my biggest pain points?
* Do I need to change my behavior to use it?

### Tech Leadership:

* Will this product improve team efficiency?
* Can it reduce costs on new hires?

### C-Level Executives:

* Can we save money or increase profits with this product?
* Is this a groundbreaking solution in our industry?
* Can our company become a pilot or early adopter?

Tailoring messages to meet the needs of each stakeholder makes the buyer process smoother. When each individual can identify their specific pain points in your communications, they’re more likely to engage positively.

### Are You Creating Effective Customer Personas?
Now it’s time to evaluate your customer personas. Do you cover stakeholders from bottom to top? Here’s a checklist of key elements to consider when developing your personas:

Basic Information

Preferences

- Nice-to-Haves
    - Can team efficiency be improved?
    - Will the product yield additional benefits?
    - Does it offer strategic advantages, such as workflow automation?

#### Purchase Decision Makers
For high-level leadership, focus on results:

- ROI
    - How long will it take to see results?
    - Is the investment justified for the team?
    - Is it a cost-effective option?
