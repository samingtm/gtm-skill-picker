## Who is Sam 

Hi everyone! I am currently a freelancer in GTM strategies for SaaS, Database, AGI tools, and other products. Previously, I have been working as the GTM Product Manager/ Product Marketing Manager in a mainframe company for years.

I specialize in 

🖋️ **Content creation** (technical documentation, blog, tutorial, etc.) - I developed series of videos for [Zowe](https://www.zowe.org/) and several technical blogs to hit the users pain points.

📺 **Content distribution and promotion** (LinkedIn, Medium, Twitter, etc.)

💻 **SEO**

📈 **GTM strategy** (0-1 product Go-to-market planning and execution)

🆚 **Competitor analysis** (for product enhancement, user or sales experience improvement, etc.)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Open source community operations** (worked on Zowe as the doc squad co-lead)


## What Sam is learning

Though I've mastered part of the skills, I'm still learning more about the mindset, SOP, and logic of growing to be a comprehensive freelancer, including:

* SEM on Google, Meta, and Tiktok
* Market research for different industries
* Digital marketing theories and practices (this repo will also serve as a practice)
* and more..

Currently, I'm taking the [Coursera course for digital marketing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-digital-marketing-and-e-commerce/supplement/gFB3O/what-is-a-touchpoint), and I will share my notes and thoughts to this repo.

## What you can expect 

Here is the place that we can discuss the best practices in terms of content, marketing, and more!
